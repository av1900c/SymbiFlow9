## PLL tests

This directory contains tests for the `v2x_to_model.py` and `v2x_to_pb_type` tools.

## Clock associations inference

 - [ ] automatic inference is signal is associated with any clock and include the info in the model
 - [ ] automatic clock detection (signals named `*clk*` are considered as clocks)
 - [ ] signals marked with `CLOCK` attributes should be considered as clocks

## Blackbox detection

 - [ ] model of the leaf pb\_type is generated
 - [ ] leaf pb\_type xml is generated
